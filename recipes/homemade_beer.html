<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Sauce</h3>
<ol>    
<li>Fill your grain sack with your assortment of grains: 1.5 pounds of Belgian Pilsen, 12 ounces of German wheat, 12 ounces of aromatic wheat, 8 ounces of special roast and 4 ounces of caramunich malt. Tie off your sack and drop it into 3 gallons of water which has been heated to 160 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>Make sure to dunk it in and out to make sure it’s hydrated.</li>
<li>Let your grains steep for one hour, maintaining that temperature by checking in every 10 minutes.</li>
<li>While your grains are steeping, sanitize your carboy and your airlocks.</li> 
<li>Once your grains are done steeping, lift your sack out of the water and strain 4 cups of hot water through the bag until it stops dripping. Discard the grains and bring your liquid to a boil. Add in 5 pounds of Pilsen light liquid malt.</li>
<li>As soon as the liquid comes to a boil, set your timer for an hour and toss in ½ an ounce of Sorachi hops. Let your mixture boil for that hour; and when 20 minutes are remaining add in your spices: </li>
<li>3 grams of grains of paradise, 10 grams of coriander, 65 grams of peeled and sliced galangal. Wrap your spices in cheesecloth and tie it off with kitchen twine.</li>
<li>Toss your bag into the boiling wort, then at the 10 minute mark add one ounce of Styrian Goulding’s hops; finishing out the boil.</li> 
<li>Once your time is up, let your wort cool down to 80 degrees fahrenheit. Once cooled, funnel in your sanitized carboy using your sanitized funnel. Top it off with enough water to reach the 5 gallon mark.</li>
<li>Take your yeast bag and cut it open using sanitized scissors. Pour it directly into your beer, then add your prepared airlock and its stopper. Make sure it’s fully licked down on your carboy; letting it ferment at room temperature in a dark area with no sunlight for 14 days.</li>
<li>Once you’ve hit your 14 days, sanitize your bottles and prime them all with priming sugar.</li>
<li>Using a sanitized auto siphon and bottle filler,  attach your racking cane to the siphon and the other end to a bottle filler. Carefully place the siphon in your beer and begin pumping your beer through the siphon into the bottom of a beer bottle. Once you’ve reached the top of the bottle, pull your siphon out. Repeat with remaining bottles.</li>   
<li>Using a bottle capper, cap your bottles and place back in a dark place; letting them condition at room temperature for 3 weeks.</li>
<li>Once your 3 weeks have passed, place in the fridge for 24 hours.</li>
</ol>
